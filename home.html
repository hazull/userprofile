                <p>I've had a deep love for music since I was a child. I started learning the guitar in fifth grade, and since then, I've picked up a bit of drums, keyboard, and violin. I enjoy listening to a variety of artists, including Paramore, Aurora, Clairo, Girl in Red, Chappell Roan, Nora Amor, and many others. Although I’m not a professional singer, I can hold a tune and often sing alongside my brother and sister. I even had the opportunity to audition for The Voice Teens. Music has always been a big part of my life, and I continue to frow my love for it.

                <p>When the pandemic started, watching movies and TV shows became a big part of my life. It helped me feel less isolated, and I’m not going to deny that it became a way for my family to bond. Watching together has definitely made those times more enjoyable. I still watch movies up until now but not that active as I was before.
